1. run maven goal: jfx:jar (e.g. in Idea)
	1.1. it will create target\Plasmirror-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file

2. use this file as a source for .exe in Launch4j 3.13
	2.1. Open Launch4j and open Plamirror build.xml file
	2.2. Choose a correct executable file name and click on gear

3. Copy "data" folder from project to the folder with .exe file (it's required for program run)


IMPORTANT (problem with fxml files and "Location is not set" error):
fxml and css files should be packed in jar along with src so that another JavaFX windows could be open (such as help window).
For this I had to add these lines to pom.xml

```
<resource>
    <directory>src/main/resources/fxml</directory>
    <targetPath>fxml</targetPath>
    <includes>
        <include>**/*.fxml</include>
    </includes>
</resource>
<resource>
    <directory>src/main/resources/css</directory>
    <targetPath>css</targetPath>
    <includes>
        <include>**/*.css</include>
    </includes>
</resource>
```

Also I had to change "fxml${sep}help${sep}HelpInfo.fxml" to "fxml/help/HelpInfo.fxml", etc.
All this was made on Windows. No idea, what's going on here
